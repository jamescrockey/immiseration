As a robustness check, we are able to reproduce the results of the regressions for real wage using the full CPS sample, rather than the restricted sample which allows us to merge the data to the Economic Census. For brevity, we include only the key variables of interest.

\begin{tablenotes}{\item  \emph{Notes:} This table presents estimates of Equation~(\ref{eq:wageregs}) but pooling across industries, including  covariates and fixed effects.  The specification estimated is: $c^{i}_{j,t}= \gamma^{i}_{g} + X'_{j,t}\beta^{i}  +\delta_{s}  + \varepsilon^{i}_{j,t}$. Where $c^{i}_{j,t}$, the dependent variable, is the log wage. The data from the CPS and BEA are merged at the state geographic level and one-digit industry code as described in Appendix~\ref{sec:data_appendix}. The generation variables are all dummy variables defined on the basis of date of birth, as per Table~\ref{cohortdef}. The omitted categories are the Silent Generation, retail industry and managerial professional speciality. Standard errors are in parenthesis. $^{***}$ Significant at the $1\%$ level.$^{**}$ Significant at the $5\%$ level. $^{*}$ Significant at the $10\%$ level.}

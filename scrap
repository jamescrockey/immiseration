\textbf{It also means we are able to build on the recent literature documenting and explaining the decline in the labour share (\citealp{Karabarbounis2008,Elsby2013,Piketty2014,autoretal:2020,Grossman2018} and particularly \citealp{autoretal:2020}) to test whether, other things being equal, the decline in median lifetime earnings is, in part, due to reductions across generations in their average labour share. }


\textbf{Delete: We estimate this equation separately for each industry $i$ so that we allow both the structure of earnings differences across generations to vary by industry.  To allow for these changes in the sectoral and geographic composition of the US economy as well as the changing role of education and demographic characteristics means that we will estimate separate specifications for each industry. At the cost of additional coefficients to consider, this allows for unrestricted heterogeneity across specifications as well as ease of interpretation. It will also highlight important sources of heterogeneity.  This also means that we allow the effects of both observables, such as age, education, or race, and the fixed effects to vary across industries in an unrestricted way. This is important since, for example, there is good to reason to believe that the return to education may differ by sector.  }


\textbf{Rewrite:This section proceeds as follows. First, we outline our measure of the labour share and then introduce our regression specification. We then present our estimates of intergenerational differences in log wages and the labour share. }
